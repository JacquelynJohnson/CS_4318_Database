Abstract

The proposed database will allow for a logical and concise storage 
of data collected from the Gen III MicroPlate Biolog lab being conducted at 
Lone Star College-Montgomery. This database application will allow students and professors
the ability to query through large amounts of data collected, draw inferences from the data to
extend hypothesis, and further the research in the field of microbiology 
pertaining to this specific lab. The platform is a MySQL database with 
the application GUI written in VB using Windows Forms App(.NET Framework).
The result is a database which enables students and professors to enter, manage, 
and query data through a user-friendly interface.
